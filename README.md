## Assignments  

### **Assignment 1: Measures of Central Tendency**  
- **Objective**:  
  Analyze various measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) in a dataset.  
- **Dataset**:  
  Chlorophyll levels measured in 100 plant samples collected from two types of forests.  
- **Analysis**:  
  - Descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset.  
  - Comparison of chlorophyll levels between forest types.  
- **Tools Used**:  
  - **Python**: NumPy and Pandas for computation.  
  - **R**: Descriptive statistics and visualization.

### **Assignment 2: Agglomerative Clustering of SRBCT**  
- **Objective**:  
  Perform agglomerative clustering on gene expression data for different types of **Small Round Blue Cell Tumors (SRBCT)**.  
- **Analysis**:  
  - Examined how clusters form based on varying distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) and linkage methods (e.g., single, complete, average).  
  - Studied clustering results to identify patterns in gene expression across tumor types.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Understanding cancer subtype classification based on gene expression.  
- **Tools Used**:  
  - **Python**: Scikit-learn for clustering.  
  - **R**: Visualization of dendrograms.

### **Assignment 3: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
- **Objective**:  
  Perform PCA on a dataset containing gene expression values of **21,487 genes** across **20 different tissue/cell lines of Chinese hamsters**.  
- **Analysis**:  
  - Reduced dimensionality and visualized clusters using PC1 vs. PC2 plots.  
  - Identified top contributing genes for the principal components.  
  - Investigated biological relevance of clusters and major contributing genes.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Simplifying complex datasets while retaining significant variance.  
  - Insight into tissue-specific gene expression.  
- **Tools Used**:  
  - **Python**: NumPy, Matplotlib for PCA and visualization.  
  - **R**: Statistical validation and detailed analysis.

## Group Project  

### **Title**: Gene Expression Profile at Single-Cell Level of Hippocampal Organoids  
- **Objective**:  
  Perform novel analysis using single-cell gene expression data from hippocampal organoids.  
- **Analysis**:  
  - Investigated cellular heterogeneity in hippocampal organoids.  
  - Clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques were applied to identify distinct cell populations.  
  - Functional annotation of gene clusters and pathway analysis.  
- **Tools Used**:  
  - **Python**: For preprocessing and clustering.  
  - **R**: For detailed pathway enrichment and gene ontology analysis.  
- **Outcome**:  
  - Insights into the functional diversity of cell types in hippocampal organoids.  
  - Identification of potential marker genes for specific cell populations.
