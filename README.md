## Analysis & Interpretation of Biological Data
### Assignment 1
Analyzing various measures of central tendency of a dataset. Dataset comprises measurements of chlorophyll levels from 100 plant samples collected from two types of forests.

### Assignment 2
Performed agglomerative clustering of different types of SRBCT (small round blue cell tumours of childhood) to study the gene expression patterns
Analyzed how the clustering changes based on changes in distance and linkage metrics

### Assignment 3
Principal Component Analysis on a dataset containing gene expression values of 21487 genes measure accross 20 different tissue/cell lines of Chinese Hamsters
Clusters from PC1 vs PC2 plot were also analyzed and top contributor genes were identified

### Group Project
Using the concepts and analysis techniques taught in the course, perform novel analysis on biological data and report your interpretation of the result.

Project : Gene Expression profile at single cell level of hippocampal organoids
